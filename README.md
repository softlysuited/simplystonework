Beautiful and colorful stone types!

Simply Stonework is a small mod designed to add different stone types to the game, for better building!

It adds 4 new stone types: Schist (blue), Norite (green), Pegmatite (yellow), and Shale (black/purple). The raw versions of these stones generate in the world.
The generation is similar to Andesite, Granite, and Diorite.
Each stone type can be crafted into Polished, Chiseled, and Brick types (as well as the requisite stairs, slabs, and walls).
For ease of understanding, this crafting is pretty much the same as with the usual stone types.
Simply Stonework also adds Brick and Chiseled versions of Andesite, Granite, and Diorite.

Some of the base textures used in this mod are not made by me. The Andesite, Diorite, and Granite textures are made by DRULLKUS, and are used with permission.

The code of this mod was created using Mcreator.
